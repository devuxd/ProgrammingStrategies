# Fix the calculator

In this task, you'll fix a problem with this web-based calculator

[Broken Calculator](https://codepen.io/andyjko/pen/wPoLmB?editors=0010)

Here are the reproduction steps for the problem:

* Click the "1" key
* Click the "+" key
* Click the "9" key
* The number 9 should appear in the calculator's display, but it does not.

**Find and fix this defect by working backwards systematically from the failure to the cause**. You have up to 25 minutes. When you believe you've found the best fix, tell the experimenter which text on which line of code you changed (e.g., line 27, replace "hello" with "goodbye").
