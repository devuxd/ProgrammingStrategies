A programming strategy constitute a high-level plan for accomplishing a programming tasks. Imagine trying to debug a deadlock. What would you do first? Set a breakpoint and use the debugger to inspect what locks have aquired? Or add a log statement before each related call to acquire or release a resource? Each of these constitute the first actions in a programming strategy, enumerating a set of steps to accomplish a specific goal.
