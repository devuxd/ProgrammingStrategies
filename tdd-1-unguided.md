# Autocomplete

In this task, you'll design and implement a simple autocomplete feature.

[Autocomplete starter code] (code here)

Whenever the user begins typing a new word, your autocomplete will recommend possible completions based on the words that the user has already entered in the text area.

**Design and implement the autocomplete feature.** You have up to 15 minutes. Notify the experimenter when you're done.
